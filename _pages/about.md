I am a 4th year UCLA Buster. If you want to learn more about how much of a buster I am, you can find it here.

I am pursing a career in medicine. As a buster, I can only imagine myself doing being a Dr. Buster.

I also love Jesus.

If you are interested in any of this or me, please do explore more and shoot me an email!
